    <p>
      Hi! I'm Daniel Gardner and welcome to my page. I am a full stack web
      developer just starting off in the industry. I'm currently enrolled in the
      full stack web developer bootcamp at the University of Penn. I am from
      philadelphia, Pennsylvania. I was formally educated in the Philadelphia
      school district, before ultimately graduating in 2006. I spent sometime in
      the workforce before entering into a program to become a licensed boiler
      plant operator for the city of philadelphia school district.
      Professionally, I have worked in a number of environments from sky
      scrapers, to schools, to prisons. Working on boiler plants with heating
      and refrigeration. I would continue on this path for a number of years
      before deciding to venture down this path of tech. I've always been a fan
      of computers and technology so coding made sense to me. I have a number of
      online businesses that I have started and operated but this bootcamp
      course through UPenn has given me the opportunity to see whats really
      happening behind the curtains. So far I've made a few projects and
      included them here in this web page. Feel free to checkout my repository
      and my code to see my progress. Happy coding everyone!!
