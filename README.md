## Description

The purpose of the Work portfolio project was to create a React app using create-react-app and artistically express my skills by crafting this webpage. All code has been thoroughly reviewed and structured in proper syntax. I created multiple pages and included multple links to create a fluid webpage UI that's also user friendly. All code and links have been tested for functionality.
