          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hi! I'm Daniel Gardner and welcome to my page. I am a full stack web
            developer just starting off in the industry. I'm currently enrolled
            in the full stack web developer bootcamp at the University of Penn.
            I am from philadelphia, Pennsylvania. I was formally educated in the
            Philadelphia school district, before ultimately graduating in 2006.
            I spent sometime in the workforce before entering into a program to
            become a licensed boiler plant operator for the city of philadelphia
            school district. Professionally, I have worked in a number of
            environments from sky scrapers, to schools, to prisons. Working on
            boiler plants with heating and refrigeration. I would continue on
            this path for a number of years before deciding to venture down this
            path of tech. I've always been a fan of computers and technology so
            coding made sense to me. I have a number of online businesses that I
            have started and operated but this bootcamp course through UPenn has
            given me the opportunity to see whats really happening behind the
            curtains. So far I've made a few projects and included them here in
            this web page. Feel free to checkout my repository and my code to
            see my progress. Happy coding everyone!!
